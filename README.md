* Use aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) to analyze data.
* Apply filtering, sorting, and grouping to generate meaningful insights.
* Implement foreign keys and understand data relationships.

## Detailed Requirement
Step 1: Database Design
Step 2: Populating the Database
Step 3: Queries and Analysis
* Find the total sales (SUM) for each product category.
